# Note: Setting the split ratio of the parent internal node is a direct resize
# Note: st terminal,zoom text with TERMMOD: shift control pageup/down

# Search keys, example p: /\v\+ .*p
# 
# Key chord chains are used for less common or ancillary commands, or
# for when assigning direct keybindings would become unwieldy.  The idea
# is to scope bindings so as to avoid conflicts.
# Try to use shift for extending related functionality
#
