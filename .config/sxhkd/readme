# Note: st terminal,zoom text with TERMMOD: shift control pageup/down

# Search keys, example p: /\v\+ .*p
# 
# Key chord chains are used for less common or ancillary commands, or
# for when assigning direct keybindings would become unwieldy.  The idea
# is to scope bindings so as to avoid conflicts.
# Try to use shift for extending related functionality
#
# Overview letters prepended by the super key:
# a (CHAIN advanced node actions) (focus node jump: r,p,b,comma(first),period(second)) (set flags:hlmsp)
# b (swap biggest)
# c (focus next/previous node) 
# d (dmenu)
# e (common.sxhkdrc: CHAIN environment)
# f (fullscreen)
# g (common.sxhkdrc: CHAIN gui applications)
# h j k l (navigation, replace, resize. Most important vim like keys)
# i (focus newer node in history)
# m (monocle)
# n (advanced operations, receptacles and scripted actions)
# o (focus older node in history)
# p (CHAIN preselect using hjkl 0-9 and space)

# r (rotate). Note r is used with super+alt
# s (CHAIN split ratio, equalize, balance, automatic_scheme)
# t (tiled)
# u (circUlate)
# v (flip Vlip. Note: Select a parent manually)
# w (close or kill node)
# x (common.sxhkdrc, terminal programs)
# y (sends newest marked to preselected area)
# z (switch to other sxhkd mode)
#
# space: (window state: switch to floating, pseudo-tiled)
# grave: (last focused node)
# tab: (last focused desktop)
# bracked: (focus the next/previous desktop in the current monitor)
# escape: (reload sxhkd)
# alt (bspc quit restart: uses qr)
