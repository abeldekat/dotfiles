:: removing adobe-source-code-pro-fonts breaks dependency 'adobe-source-code-pro-fonts' required by gsettings-desktop-schemas
gsettings-desktop-schemas: requires the adobe font and also cantarell
glib-networking is dependant
libsoup
rest
gtk3

Thus: The adobe and cantarell fonts are very indirectly required by gtk3
