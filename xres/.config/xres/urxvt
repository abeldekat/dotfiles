! Basic settings

! UI components

! Cursor
! Allowing the cursor to use the reverse colour of the background or
! foreground avoids circumstances, such as in Vim, where the cursor can
! be virtually impossible to see.  Note that this does not work when the
! cursor is not a block character (cursorUnderLine: true).

! Bell

! Text highlighting

! Font settings

! Scroll and output

! Backspace behaviour

! Key bindings.  Use C-S-{c,v} to copy/paste as in GNOME terminal.  The
! keys "Prior" and "Next" represent PgUp and PgDown respectively.
