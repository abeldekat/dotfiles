# Given the default and a dark theme:
# On focus the text will be darker and there will be a background highlighting the number. Unoccupied: Light. Occupied: darker
# Unfocused desktops: When occupied then fg is same as background focused occupied
# Layout and state,  same no background highlight but with lightest fg color. 

# Urgency: Same as the example.  Unfocussed: No background, fg is red. Clearly visible. Focussed: Red background, dark text. 

# Monitors: Example, active monitor bright white fg on blue background. Inactive monitor: No background, bright text, blueish. Note that when the monitor is inactive the desktops will not have a background. They fallback to occupied, not focussed occupied. The focussed occupied background is used as underline. 

# Main difference to example: The hasfocus bg always looks the same. The text indicates if the desktop is occupied. In this implemenation the text is always the same on focus. The background differs
